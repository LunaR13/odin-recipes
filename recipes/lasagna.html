    <h2><p>Description</p></h2>
    <p>When a hot and bubbly baking dish filled with homemade lasagna hits the dinner table, it’s guaranteed to disappear fast! Multiple layers of noodles, cheese, and sauce are the best kind of edible architecture. I like to treat my Italian family with this comfort food because it always brings smiles at the end of a long day.</p>
    <p>Using convenient pantry staples makes preparation easy, while effortlessly bumping up the flavor of the meat sauce and cheese layers. Ripe canned tomatoes and dried herbs help to instantly boost the flavor. If you’re in a pinch for time, make the layers in advance and bake when you’re ready to serve, it’s a game-changer!</p>
    <h2><p>Ingredients</p></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Quarts of Water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt </li>
            <li>1 pound lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly whisked</li>
            <li>32 ounces whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><p>Steps</p></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until al dente, about 8 minutes. Carefully remove the lasagna noodles and transfer them to a sheet pan lined with clean kitchen towels. Place them in a single layer, to keep them from sticking together. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl whisk together eggs, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and chopped parsley.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1 cup of meat sauce and 1 cup of grated mozzarella cheese for topping the lasagna. Lightly coat a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish with oil. Add just enough sauce to lightly cover the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Layer 3 to 4 sheets of lasagna, top with ⅓ of ricotta cheese mixture, ⅓ meat sauce, and ⅓ of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat for 2 more layers. On the top layer pour the reserved meat sauce and cover evenly with the reserved mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Line a sheet tray with foil and place the lasagna tray on top. Loosely cover with foil, making sure not to touch the top with the cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil. Bake until the cheese is hot and bubbly on top, about 15 minutes.  The lasagna can be brolied for a few minutes right before removing from the oven for an extra browned crust.</li>
            <li>Before slicing, allow the lasagna to rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
